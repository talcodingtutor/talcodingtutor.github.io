        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Tal Nir! I'm a Senior Software Developer with over 15 years of
          experience in the tech world. I've built games, apps, and all sorts of
          fun projects. Now, I want to bring the magic of coding to kids! I
          believe that learning to code can be just like playing a game:
          challenging, exciting, and super fun. I provide tutoring in both
          English and Hebrew, and I can't wait to start this coding adventure
          with your child!
